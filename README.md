# hyperparams-free-3D-losses
This repository contains the implementation of the losses used in the paper "Hyperparameter-Free Losses for Model-Based Monocular Reconstruction".

We also provide the 3D annotations in MICC and FaceWarehouse datasets that were used for the evaluation of the models in the paper.

## Installation

To install:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you can run the tests to ensure everything is working properly

```
python -m unittest
```


## Usage

Running an example on how to use the losses:

```
python main.py
```
